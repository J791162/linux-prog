Understanding how to read this output is useful to all unix users, but especially people using group access permissions. 
Field 1:   a set of ten permission flags. 
Field 2:   link count (don't worry about this)
Field 3:   owner of the file
Field 4:   associated group for the file
Field 5:   size in bytes
Field 6-8: date of last modification (format varies, but always 3 fields)
Field 9:   name of file (possibly with path, depending on how ls was called)
